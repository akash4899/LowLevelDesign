1. The elevator system should consist of multiple elevators serving multiple floors.
2. Each elevator should have a capacity limit and should not exceed it.
3. Users should be able to request an elevator from any floor and select a destination floor.
4. The elevator system should efficiently handle user requests and optimize the movement of elevators to minimize waiting time.
5. The system should prioritize requests based on the direction of travel and the proximity of the elevators to the requested floor.
6. The elevators should be able to handle multiple requests concurrently and process them in an optimal order.
7. The system should ensure thread safety and prevent race conditions when multiple threads interact with the elevators.

I’m only going to talk about INET (i.e. IPv4) sockets, but they account for at least 99% of the sockets in use. And I’ll only talk about STREAM (i.e. TCP) sockets - unless you really know what you’re doing (in which case this HOWTO isn’t for you!), you’ll get better behavior and performance from a STREAM socket than anything else. I will try to clear up the mystery of what a socket is, as well as some hints on how to work with blocking and non-blocking sockets. But I’ll start by talking about blocking sockets. You’ll need to know how they work before dealing with non-blocking sockets.

Part of the trouble with understanding these things is that “socket” can mean a number of subtly different things, depending on context. So first, let’s make a distinction between a “client” socket - an endpoint of a conversation, and a “server” socket, which is more like a switchboard operator. The client application (your browser, for example) uses “client” sockets exclusively; the web server it’s talking to uses both “server” sockets and “client” sockets.
